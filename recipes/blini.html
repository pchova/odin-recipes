            <h1>Blini (Russian Crepes)</h1>

            <img src="../images/blini.jpg" alt="Russian crepe like pancakes, stacked high on a plate">

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This recipe is a Russian food eaten especially during the Holiday of 
                Maslenitsa, or traditionally, a pagan holiday to celebrate the coming of
                Spring. Very similar to French crepes, they are topped with sour cream
                and jam, or rolled with savory fillings like meat or potatoes and cheese.
            </p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Milk (Soy or coconut milk works best for non-dairy option)</li>
                <li>Flour</li>
                <li>Sugar</li>
                <li>Honey</li>
                <li>Neutral Oil, like sunflower</li>
                <li>2 Eggs</li>
                <li>Pinch of salt</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a big bowl, combine eggs with half of the milk, honey and salt.</li>
                <li>When fully whisked, add flour in small portions and mix to prevent lumps.</li>
                <li>Gradually add in the rest of the milk after the flour. The mixture should be
                    smooth, the consistency similar to heavy cream. It should be more on the liquid side.
                </li>
                <li>Add in the oil on top and mix lightly, and let sit for 20 min.</li>
                <li>Preheat a non-stick frying pan on medium heat and add some butter.</li>
                <li>Use a ladle to pour in some batter and tilt the pan to cover the bottom with 
                    batter, forming a thin layer of crepe. Cook for about a minute, then flip.
                </li>
                <li>Cook other side until it's fully cooked on each side and remove to a plate. Spread 
                    a little bit butter to prevent sticking. Add more butter to the pan, and repeat 
                    until you have used all the batter.
                </li>
                <li>Top with sour cream and serve.</li>
            </ol>
